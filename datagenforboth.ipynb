The demand for $ 280bn ( £155bn ) - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - was rejected in a 2-1 decision . The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws . Among the accused were Altria Group , RJ Reynolds Tobacco , Lorillard Tobacco , Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson . In its case , the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction , targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns , lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary . Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $ 280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products . But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business . The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public .

Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role . But Mr Wyatt argued : `` By some way , he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world . `` So , it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections . '' Labour 's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda . However , Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget . The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been `` trying very hard '' to improve his own standing with the electorate through a `` sort of campaign of trust '' . But Mr Blair had been `` hurt '' by the Iraq controversy , he added .

Asked if this amounted to the party 's much vaunted `` decapitation strategy '' Lord Rennard said it was not a term he had ever used . But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives . `` I just do n't think Labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a Conservative . '' He denied this strategy was opportunism , insisting the Lib Dem 's policies on issues such as tuition fees , the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed `` to all sides of the political spectrum '' . `` We are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote Liberal Democrat , '' he added . A Conservative spokesperson said : `` The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy . The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies . `` We will be pointing out how they are soft on crime , how they support higher taxes , their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving Europe more control over our lives '' .\",\n",

Earlier , Mr Kennedy told Radio 4 's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament . `` We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party , '' he said . Mr Kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing Monday 's Commons vote on the government 's controversial anti-terrorism laws , along with 16 other Lib Dem MPs . On Saturday , the Lib Dem chief executive said it was `` just a cock-up '' that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote , which the government won by a majority of only 14 . `` Nobody had any idea that was going to happen , '' Lord Rennard told reporters at the party conference .

BA 's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m , and it expects a rise in full-year revenues .

Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA 's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m .

The party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and Labour . Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair 's record in government . Labour 's rule has been characterised by `` lost trust and failure to deliver '' , he told the Brighton conference . He also attacked the government 's `` failure '' to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS , telling delegates Labour can not be trusted on education or crime . A Tory government would sort out the `` shambles '' of immigration , put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools , he said . Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by £4bn . BBC political correspondent Shaun Ley says opinion polls suggest the Tories still lag some way behind Labour on the issues of health , education and the economy .
