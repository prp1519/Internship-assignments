              "  'And this is not the first time similarity of thought between Maryam and Khaqan has been witnessed.While Mian Nawaz Sharif and Maryam have the same opinion on all matters, Shahid Khaqan is a true follower of the father and daughter.Interestingly, PDM President Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s stance about the possibility of the PPP and the ANP returning to the alliance’s fold is even harsher.',\n",

He also attacked the government 's `` failure '' to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS , telling delegates Labour can not be trusted on education or crime .

For the full-year , TimeWarner posted a profit of $ 3.36bn , up 27 % from its 2003 performance , while revenues grew 6.4 % to $ 42.09bn . `` Our financial performance was strong , meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility , '' chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said . For 2005 , TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5 % , and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins . TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators . It has already offered to pay $ 300m to settle charges , in a deal that is under review by the SEC . The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves , which it previously set at $ 500m . It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann 's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe , which it had reported as advertising revenue .

China 's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency 's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive . But calls for a shift in Beijing 's policy have fallen on deaf ears , despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the `` time is ripe '' for a loosening of the peg . The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy . In the meantime , the US Federal Reserve 's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates . The half-point window , some believe , could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive , and could help prop up the dollar . The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits , as well as the US 's yawning current account gap , both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments . The White House will announce its budget on Monday , and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars .\",\n",

SharesA US government claim accusing the country 's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court . The demand for $ 280bn ( £155bn ) - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - was rejected in a 2-1 decision . The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws . Among the accused were Altria Group , RJ Reynolds Tobacco , Lorillard Tobacco , Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson . In its case , the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction , targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns , lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary .
