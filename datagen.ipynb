The party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and Labour . Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair 's record in government . Labour 's rule has been characterised by `` lost trust and failure to deliver '' , he told the Brighton conference . He also attacked the government 's `` failure '' to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS , telling delegates Labour can not be trusted on education or crime . A Tory government would sort out the `` shambles '' of immigration , put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools , he said . Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by Â£4bn . BBC political correspondent Shaun Ley says opinion polls suggest the Tories still lag some way behind Labour on the issues of health , education and the economy . Conservative leader Michael Howard , who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday , will address them in a lunchtime speech .

After the vote , Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election .

China 's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency 's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive . But calls for a shift in Beijing 's policy have fallen on deaf ears , despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the `` time is ripe '' for a loosening of the peg .

A Tory government would sort out the `` shambles '' of immigration , put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools , he said .

But the vote prompted constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell to resign in protest . The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed . Mr Sayeed had denied the claims , saying the suspension was `` unjust and wrong '' but he made an `` unreserved '' apology to MPs in the Commons chamber .
