The party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and Labour . Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair 's record in government . Labour 's rule has been characterised by `` lost trust and failure to deliver '' , he told the Brighton conference . He also attacked the government 's `` failure '' to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS , telling delegates Labour can not be trusted on education or crime . A Tory government would sort out the `` shambles '' of immigration , put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools , he said . Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by £4bn . BBC political correspondent Shaun Ley says opinion polls suggest the Tories still lag some way behind Labour on the issues of health , education and the economy . Conservative leader Michael Howard , who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday , will address them in a lunchtime speech . His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party 's opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament . The bill\",\n",

The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament . The Mid-Bedfordshire MP had denied a claim that he was paid for guiding visitors around the Palace of Westminster . Conservative leader Michael Howard has now accepted the MP 's resignation , it has been announced . Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen `` well below the standards expected '' . The Conservative Party had already been withdrawn the whip for a month . But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him , with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes . After the vote , Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election . But the vote prompted constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell to resign in protest . The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed .

I did my bit . I played my part . I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better ' .

He said it was `` nothing personal '' but that `` very many of the prominent Conservatives '' had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second .

A Tory government would sort out the `` shambles '' of immigration , put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools , he said . Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by £4bn .

Conservative leader Michael Howard , who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday , will address them in a lunchtime speech . His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party 's opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament . The bill was finally passed on Friday evening , after more than 30 hours of debate .

The Conservative Party had already been withdrawn the whip for a month . But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him , with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes . After the vote , Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election . But the vote prompted constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell to resign in protest . The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed . Mr Sayeed had denied the claims , saying the suspension was `` unjust and wrong '' but he made an `` unreserved '' apology to MPs in the Commons chamber . He insisted that the committee 's report had contained a `` few errors of fact '' . Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997 . He represented Bristol East from 1983 to 1992 .\",\n",

The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public . They also say they have already met many of the government 's demands in a landmark $ 206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998 . SharesA US government claim accusing the country 's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court . The demand for $ 280bn ( £155bn ) - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - was rejected in a 2-1 decision . The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws . Among the accused were Altria Group , RJ Reynolds Tobacco , Lorillard Tobacco , Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson . In its case , the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction , targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns , lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary . Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $ 280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products . But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business . The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public . They also say they have already met many of the government 's demands in a landmark $ 206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998 .
